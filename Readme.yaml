## 🔬 Visual Assets You Should Include

- 📈 Confusion matrix
- 📉 ROC curve with AUC
- 📸 Grad-CAM overlays showing where the model is “looking”
- 🧱 Model architecture summary (Keras `model.summary()`)

---

## 🧪 Tools and Libraries

- Python, TensorFlow or PyTorch
- Keras, OpenCV
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Sklearn (metrics)
- Streamlit (optional for UI)

---

## ✅ Next Steps

Would you like me to:
1. Build the full notebooks and scripts for CNN, VGG16, ResNet?
2. Provide Grad-CAM implementation?
3. Generate visualizations (Confusion matrix, ROC)?
4. Create a mini Streamlit web app for demo?

Tell me which pieces you want and I’ll build them step-by-step!
